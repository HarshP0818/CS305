Artemis Financial was a client that specializes in financial services and needed help improving the security of its software application. The company wanted me to address software security vulnerabilities that could put sensitive financial data at risk. Their main concern was ensuring their system was properly protected against threats like SQL injection, insecure authentication, and data leaks, while keeping their application functional for users.

When identifying Artemis Financial’s software security vulnerabilities, I did well in thoroughly reviewing the code and application workflows to find weaknesses. I focused on using secure coding practices, such as input validation, proper encryption methods, and strong authentication checks. Coding securely is crucial because it protects sensitive user information, maintains customer trust, prevents financial losses, and ensures the company’s reputation stays strong. Solid software security adds value by reducing risks, improving system reliability, and meeting regulatory compliance requirements.

One of the more challenging but helpful parts of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that security improvements didn’t accidentally break the application’s functionality. Balancing usability with security took careful testing and review, but it also gave me valuable experience in real-world problem-solving.

To increase layers of security, I implemented input validation, encrypted sensitive data, strengthened password requirements, and added proper error handling to avoid exposing system details. In the future, I would continue using automated tools like static analysis scanners and vulnerability assessment tools (such as OWASP ZAP or SonarQube) alongside manual code reviews to find and prioritize risks, then select appropriate mitigation strategies based on severity and impact.

After refactoring the code, I made sure the software was still functional and secure by performing unit testing, integration testing, and security testing. I checked for new vulnerabilities using both automated scans and manual walkthroughs of the updated code to verify that the changes strengthened the system rather than introducing new problems.

Some helpful tools and practices from this project included the OWASP Top Ten guidelines, secure code review checklists, automated security scanning tools, and consistent use of version control to track and revert changes if needed. These practices will definitely be useful in future assignments and professional projects.

For future employers, I would highlight this project as an example of my ability to conduct a vulnerability assessment, apply secure coding techniques, refactor an application without losing functionality, and document my process clearly. This demonstrates technical skill, attention to detail, and a commitment to building reliable, secure software.
